# Single file web components

## Requirements


* Web components compiler, using <my-web-component/> compiles to HTML with defined conventions from web standards.
* Streamable.
* Parse with the same rules as browsers https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1559159122964127744
* Syntax should appear as if baseline webc component does not require compilation (but components _are_ compiled).
* HTML
	* Just put the HTML in the thing, no `<template>` required (a la Svelte, not Vue).
	* Using raw `<template>` has no special behavior, it outputs a `<template>`.
	* Use `<template webc:type>` to replace itself with the output from any custom external template syntax engine (async-friendly)
	* Use `<template webc:type webc:keep>` to replace the contents (not itself)
	* Apply `[slot]` (attribute) sources to `<slot>` elements in components.
		* Use `[slot][webc:raw]` to opt-out and keep a slot for clientside use.
	* Component tags are excluded from client output for HTML-only components (no CSS or JS)
		* Opt out with `webc:keep` attribute
		* If component contains `<style>` or `<script>`, tag *is* included (for client component behavior/styling)
	* Server components can be used on the client
* CSS
	* Use `<style>` for CSS
	* Styles are extracted from component definition and rolled up for re-use.

## TODOs

* Whatâ€™s the difference between `webc:keep` and `webc:raw` Can we combine them??
* Allow using is="" for component redefinition
* Components are compiled to server and/or client modes (or mix and match both)
* Component name is implied from the file name (override)
* Options to set override default formats for `<template type>`, `<style type>`, and `<script type>`
* How to assign top-level component attributes from inside the component definition?
	* I want a `class` attribute added from inside the component, maybe `<div webc:root class="">`?
* ~~single tags e.g. <img>~~
* ~~Use <body> and <html> in the content~~
* ~~Use a doctype~~
* ~~Option to compile away the parent element (automatic when no style or script)~~

## Notes

* Attribute name considerations https://www.razzed.com/2009/01/30/valid-characters-in-attribute-names-in-htmlxml/

Marketing ideas:
* Tired of waiting for browser support for Declarative Shadow DOM? Donâ€™t want the performance/functionality fallbacks from the polyfill?
* Show a component with clientside support and registration
* Show an example of using declarative shadow DOM with this.

## HTML

* ~Version 2: preprocess using another file extension? e.g. `.webc.html`, `.webc.liquid`, `.webc.md`
* ~~TODO `<slot>` for server slots (maintain `<slot>` as is)~~
* ~~TODO? compilation: how to use template literals in `<template>`~~ instead use `<script type="webc/render">`

## Style

* Use `<link rel="stylesheet" href>` for remote CSS
* Compilation via `<style type>`: e.g. `<style type="sass">` to another not-CSS language
  * maybe also support `text/sass`?
  * Ignoring `type="text/css"`
~~* TODO Compilation: automatically bundle away `<style>`? Or use `<style bundle>` aggregates to page bundle~~
* Compilation: `<style webc:scoped>` adds a svelte-style prefix to styles based on a hash of the style content!
* If styles are NOT scoped include a unique component classname checker with error messaging for duplicate classname re-use.

* ~Version 2: Compilation: `<style webc:src>` inlines the thing
* ~Version 2: Compilation: `<link rel="stylesheet" href webc:scoped>`

## Script

* `<script>` for client JS
* `<script type="webc">` follows 11ty.js conventions for js (optional exports for `data` and `render`)
* maybe: `<script type="webc/data">`
* maybe: `<script type="webc/render">`
* TODO: how to serialize data/props for use on the client
* TODO: how to differentiate server and client js

* ~Version 2: Compilation: `<script type="ts">`

## Open Questions

* Integration with `<is-land>`

## Prior Art

### Vue

https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html#why-sfc

(implied component name via filename)
<template></template>
<template src></template>
<template lang></template>

<style></style>
<style scoped></style>
<style module></style>
<style module="jsVarName"></style>
<style src></style> ðŸ˜…
<style lang></style>

<script></script> (implied ESM) (runs once?)
<script setup></script> (runs per instance)
<script src></script>
<script lang></script>

### Svelte

No `template` (just sibling content)

<style></style>
<style scoped></style>

<script></script> (runs per instance?)
<script context="module"></script> (runs once)
